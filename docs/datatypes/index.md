# Multimodal data

Whether youâ€™re working with text, image, video, audio, 3D meshes, nested data, or some combination of these, you can always represent them as Documents and process them as DocumentArrays. Here are some motivating examples:


```{toctree}
text/index
image/index
video/index
audio/index
mesh/index
tabular/index
multimodal/index
```
