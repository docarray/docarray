# Weaviate Document Index

!!! note "Install dependencies"
    To use [WeaviateDocumentIndex][docarray.index.backends.weaviate.WeaviateDocumentIndex], you need to install extra dependencies with the following command:

    ```console
    pip install "docarray[weaviate]"
    ```

This is the user guide for the [WeaviateDocumentIndex][docarray.index.backends.weaviate.WeaviateDocumentIndex],
focusing on special features and configurations of Weaviate.

For general usage of a Document Index, see the [general user guide](./docindex.md).

# 1. Start Weaviate service

To use [WeaviateDocumentIndex][docarray.index.backends.weaviate.WeaviateDocumentIndex], DocArray needs to hook into a running Weaviate service.
There are multiple ways to start a Weaviate instance, depending on your use case.

<!-- #region -->
## 1.1. Options - Overview

| Instance type | General use case | Configurability | Notes | 
| ----- | ----- | ----- | ----- | 
| **Weaviate Cloud Services (WCS)** | Development and production | Limited | **Recommended for most users** |
| **Embedded Weaviate** | Experimentation | Limited | Experimental (as of Apr 2023) |
| **Docker-Compose** | Development | Yes | **Recommended for development + customizability** |
| **Kubernetes** | Production | Yes |  |

## 1.2. Instantiation instructions

### 1.2.1. WCS (managed instance)

Go to the [WCS console](https://console.weaviate.cloud) and create an instance using the visual interface, following [this guide](https://weaviate.io/developers/wcs/guides/create-instance). 

Weaviate instances on WCS come pre-configured, so no further configuration is required.

### 1.2.2. Docker-Compose (self-managed)

Get a configuration file (`docker-compose.yaml`). You can build it using [this interface](https://weaviate.io/developers/weaviate/installation/docker-compose), or download it directly with:

```bash
curl -o docker-compose.yml "https://configuration.weaviate.io/v2/docker-compose/docker-compose.yml?modules=standalone&runtime=docker-compose&weaviate_version=v<WEAVIATE_VERSION>"
```

Where `v<WEAVIATE_VERSION>` is the actual version, such as `v1.18.3`.
<!-- #endregion -->

```bash
curl -o docker-compose.yml "https://configuration.weaviate.io/v2/docker-compose/docker-compose.yml?modules=standalone&runtime=docker-compose&weaviate_version=v1.18.3"
```

<!-- #region -->
#### 1.2.2.1 Start up Weaviate with Docker-Compose

Then you can start up Weaviate by running from a shell:

```shell
docker-compose up -d
```

#### 1.2.2.2 Shut down Weaviate

Then you can shut down Weaviate by running from a shell:

```shell
docker-compose down
```

#### Notes

Unless data persistence or backups are set up, shutting down the Docker instance will remove all its data. 

See documentation on [Persistent volume](https://weaviate.io/developers/weaviate/installation/docker-compose#persistent-volume) and [Backups](https://weaviate.io/developers/weaviate/configuration/backups) to prevent this if persistence is desired.
<!-- #endregion -->

```bash
docker-compose up -d
```

<!-- #region -->
### 1.2.3. Embedded Weaviate (from the application)

With Embedded Weaviate, Weaviate database server can be launched from the client, using:

```python
from docarray.index.backends.weaviate import EmbeddedOptions

embedded_options = EmbeddedOptions()
```

## 1.3. Authentication

Weaviate offers [multiple authentication options](https://weaviate.io/developers/weaviate/configuration/authentication), as well as [authorization options](https://weaviate.io/developers/weaviate/configuration/authorization). 

With DocArray, you can use any of:

- Anonymous access (public instance),
- OIDC with username & password, and
- API-key based authentication.

To access a Weaviate instance. In general, **Weaviate recommends using API-key based authentication** for balance between security and ease of use. You can create, for example, read-only keys to distribute to certain users, while providing read/write keys to administrators.

See below for examples of connection to Weaviate for each scenario.
<!-- #endregion -->

## 1.4. Connect to Weaviate

```python
from docarray.index.backends.weaviate import WeaviateDocumentIndex
```

### Public instance

<!-- #region -->
If using Embedded Weaviate:

```python
from docarray.index.backends.weaviate import EmbeddedOptions

dbconfig = WeaviateDocumentIndex.DBConfig(embedded_options=EmbeddedOptions())
```

For all other options:
<!-- #endregion -->

```python
dbconfig = WeaviateDocumentIndex.DBConfig(
    host="http://localhost:8080"
)  # Replace with your endpoint)
```

<!-- #region -->
### OIDC with username + password

To authenticate against a Weaviate instance with OIDC username & password:

```python
dbconfig = WeaviateDocumentIndex.DBConfig(
    username="username",  # Replace with your username
    password="password",  # Replace with your password
    host="http://localhost:8080",  # Replace with your endpoint
)
```
<!-- #endregion -->

```python
# dbconfig = WeaviateDocumentIndex.DBConfig(
#     username="username",  # Replace with your username
#     password="password",  # Replace with your password
#     host="http://localhost:8080",  # Replace with your endpoint
# )
```

<!-- #region -->
### API key-based authentication

To authenticate against a Weaviate instance an API key:

```python
dbconfig = WeaviateDocumentIndex.DBConfig(
    auth_api_key="apikey",  # Replace with your own API key
    host="http://localhost:8080",  # Replace with your endpoint
)
```
<!-- #endregion -->


<!-- #region -->
# 2. Configure Weaviate

## 2.1. Overview

**WCS instances come pre-configured**, and as such additional settings are not configurable outside of those chosen at creation, such as whether to enable authentication.

For other cases, such as **Docker-Compose deployment**, its settings can be modified through the configuration file, such as the `docker-compose.yaml` file. 

Some of the more commonly used settings include:

- [Persistent volume](https://weaviate.io/developers/weaviate/installation/docker-compose#persistent-volume): Set up data persistence so that data from inside the Docker container is not lost on shutdown
- [Enabling a multi-node setup](https://weaviate.io/developers/weaviate/installation/docker-compose#multi-node-setup)
- [Backups](https://weaviate.io/developers/weaviate/configuration/backups)
- [Authentication (server-side)](https://weaviate.io/developers/weaviate/configuration/authentication)
- [Modules enabled](https://weaviate.io/developers/weaviate/configuration/modules#enable-modules)

And a list of environment variables is [available on this page](https://weaviate.io/developers/weaviate/config-refs/env-vars).

## 2.2. DocArray instantiation configuration options

Additionally, you can specify the below settings when you instantiate a configuration object in DocArray.

| name | type | explanation | default                                                                | example |
| ---- | ---- | ----------- |------------------------------------------------------------------------| ------- |
| **Category: General** |
| host | str | Weaviate instance url | http://localhost:8080                                                  |
| **Category: Authentication** |
| username | str | Username known to the specified authentication provider (e.g. WCS) | None                                                                   | `jp@weaviate.io` |
| password | str | Corresponding password | None                                                                   | `p@ssw0rd` |
| auth_api_key | str | API key known to the Weaviate instance | None                                                                   | `mys3cretk3y` | 
| **Category: Data schema** |
| index_name | str | Class name to use to store the document| The document class name, e.g. `MyDoc` for `WeaviateDocumentIndex[MyDoc]` | `Document` |
| **Category: Embedded Weaviate** |
| embedded_options| EmbeddedOptions | Options for embedded weaviate | None                                                                   |

The type `EmbeddedOptions` can be specified as described [here](https://weaviate.io/developers/weaviate/installation/embedded#embedded-options)

## 2.3. Runtime configuration

Weaviate strongly recommends using batches to perform bulk operations such as importing data, as it will significantly impact performance. You can specify a batch configuration as in the below example, and pass it on as runtime configuration.

```python
batch_config = {
    "batch_size": 20,
    "dynamic": False,
    "timeout_retries": 3,
    "num_workers": 1,
}

runtimeconfig = WeaviateDocumentIndex.RuntimeConfig(batch_config=batch_config)

dbconfig = WeaviateDocumentIndex.DBConfig(
    host="http://localhost:8080"
)  # Replace with your endpoint and/or auth settings
store = WeaviateDocumentIndex[Document](db_config=dbconfig)
store.configure(runtimeconfig)  # Batch settings being passed on
```

| name | type | explanation | default |
| ---- | ---- | ----------- | ------- |
| batch_config | Dict[str, Any] | dictionary to configure the weaviate client's batching logic | see below |

- Weaviate [docs on batching with the Python client](https://weaviate.io/developers/weaviate/client-libraries/python#batching)
<!-- #endregion -->

<!-- #region -->
## 3. Available column types

Python data types are mapped to Weaviate type according to the below conventions.

| Python type | Weaviate type |
| ----------- | ------------- |
| docarray.typing.ID | string |
| str | text |
| int | int |
| float | number |
| bool | boolean |
| np.ndarray | number[] |
| AbstractTensor | number[] |
| bytes | blob |

You can override this default mapping by passing a `col_type` to the `Field` of a schema. 

For example to map `str` to `string` you can:

```python
class StringDoc(BaseDoc):
    text: str = Field(col_type="string")
```

A list of available Weaviate data types [is here](https://weaviate.io/developers/weaviate/config-refs/datatypes).
<!-- #endregion -->

## 4. Adding example data

Putting it together, we can add data below using Weaviate as the Document Index:

```python
import numpy as np
from pydantic import Field
from docarray import BaseDoc
from docarray.typing import NdArray
from docarray.index.backends.weaviate import WeaviateDocumentIndex


# Define a document schema
class Document(BaseDoc):
    text: str
    embedding: NdArray[2] = Field(
        dims=2, is_embedding=True
    )  # Embedding column -> vector representation of the document
    file: NdArray[100] = Field(dims=100)


# Make a list of 3 docs to index
docs = [
    Document(
        text="Hello world", embedding=np.array([1, 2]), file=np.random.rand(100), id="1"
    ),
    Document(
        text="Hello world, how are you?",
        embedding=np.array([3, 4]),
        file=np.random.rand(100),
        id="2",
    ),
    Document(
        text="Lorem ipsum dolor sit amet, consectetur adipiscing elit, sed do eiusmod tempor incididunt ut",
        embedding=np.array([5, 6]),
        file=np.random.rand(100),
        id="3",
    ),
]

batch_config = {
    "batch_size": 20,
    "dynamic": False,
    "timeout_retries": 3,
    "num_workers": 1,
}

runtimeconfig = WeaviateDocumentIndex.RuntimeConfig(batch_config=batch_config)

store = WeaviateDocumentIndex[Document](db_config=dbconfig)
store.configure(runtimeconfig)  # Batch settings being passed on
store.index(docs)
```

### 4.1. Notes

- To use vector search, you need to specify `is_embedding` for exactly one field.
    - This is because Weaviate is configured to allow one vector per data object.
    - If you would like to see Weaviate support multiple vectors per object, [upvote the issue](https://github.com/weaviate/weaviate/issues/2465) which will help to prioritize it.
- For a field to be considered as an embedding, its type needs to be of subclass `np.ndarray` or `AbstractTensor` and `is_embedding` needs to be set to `True`. 
    - If `is_embedding` is set to `False` or not provided, the field will be treated as a `number[]`, and as a result, it will not be added to Weaviate's vector index.
- It is possible to create a schema without specifying `is_embedding` for any field. 
    - This will however mean that the document will not be vectorized and cannot be searched using vector search. 

## 5. Query Builder/Hybrid Search

### 5.1. Text search

To perform a text search, follow the below syntax. 

This will perform a text search for the word "hello" in the field "text" and return the first two results:

```python
q = store.build_query().text_search("world", search_field="text").limit(2).build()

docs = store.execute_query(q)
docs
```

### 5.2. Vector similarity search

To perform a vector similarity search, follow the below syntax. 

This will perform a vector similarity search for the vector [1, 2] and return the first two results:

```python
q = store.build_query().find([1, 2]).limit(2).build()

docs = store.execute_query(q)
docs
```

### 5.3. Hybrid search

To perform a hybrid search, follow the below syntax. 

This will perform a hybrid search for the word "hello" and the vector [1, 2] and return the first two results:

**Note**: Hybrid search searches through the object vector and all fields. Accordingly, the `search_field` keyword it will have no effect. 

```python
q = store.build_query().text_search("world").find([1, 2]).limit(2).build()

docs = store.execute_query(q)
docs
```

### 5.4. GraphQL query

You can also perform a raw GraphQL query using any syntax as you might natively in Weaviate. This allows you to run any of the full range of queries that you might wish to.

The below will perform a GraphQL query to obtain the count of `Document` objects. 

```python
graphql_query = """
{
  Aggregate {
    Document {
      meta {
        count
      }
    }
  }
}
"""

store.execute_query(graphql_query)
```

Note that running a raw GraphQL query will return Weaviate-type responses, rather than a DocArray object type.

You can find the documentation for [Weaviate's GraphQL API here](https://weaviate.io/developers/weaviate/api/graphql).

<!-- #region -->
## 6. Other notes

### 6.1. DocArray IDs vs Weaviate IDs

As you saw earlier, the `id` field is a special field that is used to identify a document in `BaseDoc`.

```python
Document(
    text="Hello world", embedding=np.array([1, 2]), file=np.random.rand(100), id="1"
),
```

This is not the same as Weaviate's own `id`, which is a reserved keyword and can't be used as a field name. 

Accordingly, the DocArray document id is stored internally in Weaviate as `docarrayid`.

## 7. Shut down Weaviate instance

```bash
docker-compose down
```
