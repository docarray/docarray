# First Step : BaseDoc

At the heart of `DocArray` lies the concept of [`BaseDoc`][docarray.base_doc.doc.BaseDoc].

A [BaseDoc][docarray.base_doc.doc.BaseDoc] is very similar to [Pydantic](https://docs.pydantic.dev/)
[`BaseModel`](https://docs.pydantic.dev/usage/models). It allows to define custom `Document` schema (or `Model` in
the Pydantic world) to represent your data.

## Basic `Doc` usage.

Before going in detail about what we can do with [BaseDoc][docarray.base_doc.doc.BaseDoc] and how to use it, let's
take a look at how it looks like in practice.

The following python code will define a `BannerDoc` class that will be used to represent banner data.

```python
from docarray import BaseDoc
from docarray.typing import ImageUrl


class BannerDoc(BaseDoc):
    image_url: ImageUrl
    title: str
    description: str
```

you can then instantiate a `BannerDoc` object and access its attributes.

```python
banner = BannerDoc(
    image_url="https://example.com/image.png",
    title="Hello World",
    description="This is a banner",
)

assert banner.image_url == "https://example.com/image.png"
assert banner.title == "Hello World"
assert banner.description == "This is a banner"
```

## `BaseDoc` allows to represent MultiModal and nested Data.

more complex example


## `BaseDoc` is a Pydantic `BaseModel`

The class [BaseDoc][docarray.base_doc.doc.BaseDoc] inherits from pydantic [BaseModel](https://docs.pydantic.dev/usage/models) from Pydantic. So you can use
all the features of `BaseModel` in your `Doc` class. 

This namely means that `BaseDoc`:

* Will perform data validation: `BaseDoc` will check that the data you pass to it is valid. If not, it will raise an
  error. Data being "valid" is actually define by the type use in the docstring itself, but we will come back on this concept later (TODO add typing section)

* Can be configured using a nested `Config` class, see pydantic [documentation](https://docs.pydantic.dev/usage/model_config/) for more details on what kind of config Pydantic offer.

* Can be used as a drop in replacement for `BaseModel` in your code and is compatible with tools using Pydantic like [FastAPI]('https://fastapi.tiangolo.com/').


###  What is the difference with Pydantic `BaseModel`? (INCOMPLETE)

here maybe need the link to the versus section

[BaseDoc][docarray.base_doc.doc.BaseDoc] is not only a [BaseModel](https://docs.pydantic.dev/usage/models), 

* it allows to be used with DocArray [Typed](docarray.typing) that are oriented toward MultiModal (image, audio, ...) data and for 
Machine Learning use case TODO link the type section. 

Another tiny difference is that [BaseDoc][docarray.base_doc.doc.BaseDoc] has a generated by default `id` field that is used to uniquely identify a document.
