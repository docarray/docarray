## Install

![PyPI](https://img.shields.io/pypi/v/docarray?color=%23ffffff&label=%20) is the latest version.

Make sure you have Python 3.7+ and `numpy` installed on Linux/Mac/Windows:

````{tab} Basic install

```bash
pip install docarray
```

No extra dependency will be installed.
````

````{tab} Basic install via Conda

```bash
conda install -c conda-forge docarray
```

No extra dependency will be installed.
````

````{tab} Common install

```bash
pip install "docarray[common]"
```

The following dependencies will be installed to enable the most common features:

| Package | Used in |
|---|---|
| `protobuf` | advanced serialization |
| `lz4` | compression in seralization |
| `requests` | push/pull to Jina Cloud |
| `matplotlib` | visualizing image sprites |
| `Pillow` | image data-related IO |
| `fastapi`| used in embedding projector of DocumentArray|
| `uvicorn`| used in embedding projector of DocumentArray|

````

````{tab} Full install

```bash
pip install "docarray[full]"
```

In addition to `common`, the following dependencies will be installed to enable full features:

| Package | Used in |
|---|---|
| `scipy` | for sparse embedding, tensors |
| `av` | for video processing and IO |
| `trimesh` | for 3D mesh processing and IO |
| `weaviate-client` | for using Weaviate-based document store |
| `annlite` | for using Annlite-based document store |
| `qdrant-client` | for using Qdrant-based document store |
| `strawberry-graphql` | for GraphQL support |

Alternatively, you can first do basic installation and then install missing dependencies on-demand. 
````

````{tab} Developement install

```bash
pip install "docarray[full,test]"
```

This will install all requirements for reproducing tests on your local dev environment.
````


```pycon
>>> import docarray
>>> docarray.__version__
'0.1.0'
>>> from docarray import Document, DocumentArray
```




```{important}
Jina 3.x users do not need to install `docarray` separately, as it is shipped with Jina. To check your Jina version, type `jina -vf` in the console.

However, if the printed version is smaller than `0.1.0`, say `0.0.x`, then you are 
not installing `docarray` correctly. You are probably still using an old `docarray` shipped with Jina 2.x.
