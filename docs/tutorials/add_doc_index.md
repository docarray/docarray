# Add a new Document Index

In DocArray there exists the concept of _Document Index_, a class that takes `Document`s, optionally persists them,
and makes them searchable.

There are different Document Indexes leveraging different backends, such as Weaviate, Qdrant, HNSWLib etc.

This document shows how to add a new Document Index to DocArray.

That process can be broken down into a number of basic steps:

1. Create a new class that inherits from `BaseDocumentIndex`
2. Declare default configurations for your Document Index
3. Implement abstract methods for indexing, searching, and deleting
4. Implement a Query Builder for your Document Index

In general, the steps above can be followed in roughly that order.

However, a Document Index implementation is usually very interconnected, so you will probably have to jump between these steps a bit,
both in your implementation and in the guide below.

For an end-to-end example of this process, you can check out the [existing HNSWLib Document Index implementation](https://github.com/docarray/docarray/pull/1124).

**Caution**: The HNSWLib Document Index implementation can be used as a reference, but it is special in some key ways.
For example, HNSWLib can only index vectors, so it uses SQLite to store the rest of the Documents alongside it.
This is _not_ how you should store Documents in your implementation! You can find guidance on how you _should_ do it below.

## Create a new Document Index class

To get started, create a new class that inherits from `BaseDocumentIndex` and `typing.Generic`:


```python
TSchema = TypeVar('TSchema', bound=BaseDocument)


class MyDocumentIndex(BaseDocumentIndex, Generic[TSchema]):
    ...
```

Here, `TSchema` is a type variable representing the schema of the Document Index, which is a `Document`.
You can use it in type hints of methods and attributes.

### Create the constructor

You can write an `__init__` method for your Document Index where you set up all the needed bells and whistles:

```python
def __init__(self, db_config=None, **kwargs):
    super().__init__(db_config=db_config, **kwargs)
    ...
```

Make sure that you call the `super().__init__` method, which will do some basic initialization for you.

### Set up your backend

Your backend (database or similar) should represent Documents in the following way:
- Every field of a Document is a column in the database
- Column types follow a default that you define, based on the type hint of the associated field, but can also be configures by the user
- Every row in your database thus represents a Document
- **Nesting:** The most common way to handle nested Document (and the one where the `AbstractDocumentIndex` will hold your hand the most), is to flatten out nested Documents. But if your backend natively supports nesting representations, then feel free to leverage those!

**Caution**: Don't take too much inspiration from the HNSWLib Document Index implementation on this point, as it is a bit of a special case.


Also, you should check if the Document Index is being set up "fresh", meaning no data was previously persisted.
Then you should create a new database table (or the equivalent concept in you backend) for the Documents.
Otherwise, the Document Index should connect to the existing database and table.
You can determine this based on `self._db_config` (see below).

**Note:** If you are integrating a database, your Document Index should always assume that there is already a database running that it can connect to.
It should _not_ spawn a new database instance.

To help you with all of this, `super().__init__` inject a few helpful attributes for you (more info in the dedicated sections below):

- `self._schema`
- `self._db_config`
- `self._runtime_config`
- `self._column_infos`

### The `_schema`

When a user instantiates a Document Index, they do so in a parametric way, like so:

```python
class Inner(BaseDocument):
    embedding: NdArray[512]


class MyDoc(BaseDocument):
    tensor: NdArray[100]
    other_tensor: NdArray = Field(dim=10, space='cosine')
    description: str
    inner: Inner


store = MyDocumentIndex[MyDoc]()
```

In this case, `store` would have a class attribute `_schema` that is the `MyDoc` class.
This is done automatically for you, and you can use it in your implementation.

### The `_db_config`

The `_db_config` is a dataclass that contains all "static" configurations of your Document Index.
Users can pass these configurations to the `__init__` method of your Document Index, and `self._db_config` will be populated
for you, so that you can use it in your implementation.

You can declare allowed fields and default values for your `_db_config`, but you will see that later.

### The `_runtime_config`

The `_runtime_config` is a dataclass that contains all "dynamic" configurations of your Document Index.
Users can pass these configurations to the `.configure()` method of your Document Index, and `self._runtime_config` will be populated
for you, so that you can use it in your implementation.

You can declare allowed fields and default values for your `_runtime_config `, but you will see that later.

### The `_column_infos`

`self._column_infos` is a dictionary that contains information about all columns in your Document Index instance.

This information is automatically extracted from `self._schema`, and populated for you.

Concretely, `self._column_infos: Dict[str, _ColumnInfo]` maps from a column name to a `_ColumnInfo` dataclass.

For the `MyDoc` schema above, the column names would be `tensor`, `other_tensor`, `description`, `id`, `inner__embedding`, and `inner__id`.
These are the key of `self._column_infos`.

The values of `self._column_infos` are `_ColumnInfo` dataclasses, which have the following form:

```python
@dataclass
class _ColumnInfo:
    docarray_type: Type
    db_type: Any
    n_dim: Optional[int]
    config: Dict[str, Any]
```

- `docarray_type` is the type of the column in DocArray, e.g. `NdArray` or `str`
- `db_type` is the type of the column in the Document Index, e.g. `np.ndarray` or `str`. You can customize the mapping from `docarray_type` to `db_type`, as we will see later.
- `config` is a dictionary of configurations for the column. For example, for the `other_tensor` column above, this would contain the `space` and `dim` configurations.
- `n_dim` is the dimensionality of the column, e.g. `100` for a 100-dimensional vector. See further guidance on this below.

Again, these are automatically populated for you, so you can just use them in your implementation.

### Properly handle `n_dim`

`_ColumnInfo.n_dim` is automatically obtained from type parametrizations of the form `NdArray[100]`;
if there isn't such a parametrization, `n_dim` of the columns will be `None`.

You should also provide another way of defining the dimensionality of your columns, specifically by exposing a parameter in `Field(...)` (see example schema at the top).

This leads to four possible scenarios:

**Scenario 1: Only `n_dim` is defined**

Imagine the user defines a schema like the following:

```python
class MyDoc(BaseDocument):
    tensor: NdArray[100]


index = MyDocumentIndex[MyDoc]()
```

In that case, the following will be true: `self._column_infos['tensor'].n_dim == 100` and `self._column_infos['tensor'].config == {}`.
The `tensor` column in your backend should be configured to have dimensionality 100.

**Scenario 2: Only `Field(...)` is defined**

Imagine the user defines a schema like the following:

```python
class MyDoc(BaseDocument):
    tensor: NdArray = Field(dim=50)


index = MyDocumentIndex[MyDoc]()
```

In that case, the following will be true: `self._column_infos['tensor'].n_dim is None` and `self._column_infos['tensor'].config['dim'] == 50`.
The `tensor` column in your backend should be configured to have dimensionality 50.

**Scenario 3: Both `n_dim` and `Field(...)` are defined**

Imagine the user defines a schema like the following:

```python
class MyDoc(BaseDocument):
    tensor: NdArray[100] = Field(dim=50)


index = MyDocumentIndex[MyDoc]()
```

In that case, the following will be true: `self._column_infos['tensor'].n_dim == 100` and `self._column_infos['tensor'].config['dim'] == 50`.
The `tensor` column in your backend should be configured to have dimensionality 100, as **`n_dim` takes precedence over `Field(...)`**.

**Scenario 4: Neither `n_dim` nor `Field(...)` are defined**

Imagine the user defines a schema like the following:

```python
class MyDoc(BaseDocument):
    tensor: NdArray


index = MyDocumentIndex[MyDoc]()
```

In that case, the following will be true: `self._column_infos['tensor'].n_dim is None` and `self._column_infos['tensor'].config == {}`.
If your backend can handle tensor/embedding columns without defined dimensionality, you should leverage that mechanism.
Otherwise, raise an Exception.

## Declare default configurations

We already made reference to the `_db_config` and `_runtime_config` attributes.

In order to define what can be stored in them, and what the default values are, you need to create two inner classes:

```python
@dataclass
class DBConfig(BaseDocumentIndex.DBConfig):
    ...


@dataclass
class RuntimeConfig(BaseDocumentIndex.RuntimeConfig):
    default_column_config: Dict[Type, Dict[str, Any]] = ...
```

Note that:
- `DBConfig` inherits from `BaseDocumentIndex.DBConfig` and `RuntimeConfig` inherits from `BaseDocumentIndex.RuntimeConfig`
- All fields in each dataclass need to have default values. Choose these sensibly, as they will be used if the user does not specify a value.

### The `DBConfig` class

The `DBConfig` class is used to define the static configurations of your Document Index.
These are configurations that are tied to the database (or library) running in the background, such as `host`, `port`, etc.
Here you should put everything that the user cannot or should not change after initialization.

### The `RuntimeConfig` class

The `RuntimeConfig` class is used to define the dynamic configurations of your Document Index.
These are configurations that can be changed at runtime, for example default behaviours such as batch sizes, consistency levels, etc.

It is a common pattern to allow such parameters both in the `RuntimeConfig`, where they will act as global defaults, and
in specific methods (`index`, `find`, etc.), where they will act as local overrides.

**Important**: Every `RuntimeConfig` needs to contain a `default_column_config` field.
This is a dictionary that, for each possible column type in your database, defines a default configuration for that column type.
This will automatically be passed to a `_ColumnInfo` whenever a user does not manually specify a configuration for that column.

For example, in the `MyDoc` schema above, the `tensor` `_ColumnInfo` would have a default configuration specified for `np.ndarray` columns.

What is actually contained in these type-dependant configurations is up to you (and database specific).
For example, for `np.ndarray` columns you could define the configurations `index_type` and `metric_type`,
and for `varchar` columns you could define a `max_length` configuration.

It is probably best to see this in action, so you should check out the `HnswDocumentIndex` implementation.

## Implement abstract methods for indexing, searching, and deleting

After you've done the basic setup above, you can jump into the good stuff: implementing the actual indexing, searching, and deleting.

In general, the following is true:
- For every method that you need to implement, there is a public variant (e.g. `index`) and a private variant (e.g. `_index`)
- You should usually implement the private variant, which is called by the already implemented public variant. This should make your life easier, because some preprocessing and data normalization will already be done for you.
- You can, however, also implement the public variant directly, if you want to do something special.
  - **Caution**: While this is a perfectly fine thing to do, it might create more maintenance work for you in the future, because the public variant defined in the `BaseDocumentIndex` might change in the future, and you will have to update your implementation accordingly.

Further:
- You don't absolutely have to implement everything. If a feature (e.g. `text_search`) is not supported by your backend, just raise a `NotImplementedError` in the corresponding method.
- Many methods come in a "singular" variant (e.g. `find`) and a "batched" variant (e.g. `find_batched`).
  - The "singular" variant expects a single input, be it an ANN query, a text query, a filter, etc., and return matches and scores for that single input
  - The "batched" variant expects a batch of inputs, and returns of matches and scores for each input
- Your implementations of, e.g., `_find()`, `_index()` etc. are allowed to take additional optional keyword arguments.
  These can then be used to control DB specific behaviours, such as consistency levels, batch sizes, etc. As mentioned above, it is good practice to mirror these arguments in `self.RuntimeConfig`.

Overall, you're asked to implement the methods that appear after the `Abstract methods; Subclasses must implement these`
comment in the `BaseDocumentIndex` class.
The details of each method should become clear from the docstrings and type hints.

### The `python_type_to_db_type()` method

This method is slightly special, because 1) it is not exposed to the user, and 2) you absolutely have to implement it.

It is intended to do the following: It takes a type of a field in the store's schema (e.g. `NdArray` for `tensor`), and returns the corresponding type in the database (e.g. `np.ndarray`).
The `BaseDocumentIndex` class uses this information to create and populate the `_ColumnInfo`s in `self._column_infos`.

### The `_index()` method

When indexing Documents, your implementation should behave in the following way:

- Every field in the Document is mapped to a column in the database
- This includes the `id` field, which is mapped to the primary key of the database (if your backend has such a concept)
- The configuration of that column can be found in `self._column_infos[field_name].config`
- In DocArray v1, we used to store a serialized representation of every Document. This is not needed anymore, as every row in your DB table should fully represent a single indexed Document.

To handle nested Documents, the public `index()` method already flattens every incoming Document for you.
This means that `_index()` already receives a flattened representation of the data, and you don't need to worry about that.

Concretely, the `_index()` method takes as input a dictionary of column names to column data, flattened out.
**Note:** If you (or your backend) prefer to do bulk indexing on row-wise data, then you can use the `self._transpose_col_value_dict()`
helper method. Inside of `_index()` you can use this to transform `column_to_data` into a row-wise view of the data.

**If your backend has native nesting capabilities:** You can also ignore most of the above, and implement the public `index()` method directly.
That way you have full control over whether the input data gets flattened or not.

## Implement a Query Builder for your Document Index

Every Document Index exposes a Query Builder interface which the user can use to build composed, hybrid queries.

For you as a backend integrator, there are three main things that are related to this:

- The `QueryBuilder` class that you need to implement
- The `execute_query()` method that you need to implement
- The `build_query()` method that just returns an instance of your `QueryBuilder`. You _don't_ need to implement this yourself.

Overall, this interface is very flexible, meaning that not a whole lot of structure is imposed on you.
You can decide what happens in the `QueryBuilder` class, and how the query is executed in the `execute_query()` method.
But there are a few things that you should stick to.

### Implement the `QueryBuilder` class

The QueryBuilder is what accumulates partial queries and builds them into a single query, ready to be executed.

Your Query Builder has to be an inner class of your Document Index, its class name has to be `QueryBuilder`, and it has to inherit from the Base Query Builder:

```python
class QueryBuilder(BaseDocumentIndex.QueryBuilder):
    ...
```

The Query Builder exposes the following interface:
- The same query related methods as the `BaseDocumentIndex` class (e.g. `filter`, `find`, `text_search`, and their batched variants)
- The `build()` method

The goal of it is to enable an interface for composing coplex queries, like this:

```python
index = MyDocumentIndex[MyDoc]()
q = index.build_query().find(...).filter(...).text_search(...).build()
index.execute_query(q)
```

How the individual calls to `find`, `filter`, and `text_search` are combined is up to your backend.

### Implement individual query methods

It is up to you how you implement the individual query methods, e.g. `find`, `filter`, and `text_search` of the query builder.

However, there are a few common strategies that you could use: If your backend natively supports a query builder pattern,
then you could wrap that with the DocumentIndex Query Builder interface; or you could set these methods to simply collect
arguments passed to it and defer the actual query building to the `build()` method (the `HNSWLibIndex does this); or you
could eagerly build intermediate queries at every call.

No matter what you do, you should stick to one design principle: **Every call to `find`, `filter`, `text_search` etc.
should return a new instance of the Query Builder**, with updated state.

**If your backend does not support all operations:**
Most backends do not support compositions of all query operations, which is completely fine.
If that is the case, you should handle that in the following way:
- If an operation **is** supported by the Document Index that you are implementing, but **is not** supported by the Query Builder, you should use the pre-defined `_raise_not_composable()` helper method to raise a `NotImplementedError`.
- If an operation **is not** supported by the Document Index that you are implementing, and **is not** supported by the Query Builder, you should use the pre-defined `_raise_not_supported()` helper method to raise a `NotImplementedError`.
- If an operation **is** supported by the Document Index that you are implementing, and **is** supported by the Query Builder, but **is not** supported in combination with a certain other operation, you should raise a `RuntimeError`. Depending on how your Query Builder is set up, you might want to do that either eagerly during the conflicting method call, or lazily inside of `.build()`.

### Implement the `build()` method

It is up to you how you implement the `build()` method, and this will depend on how you implemented the individual query
methods in the section above.

Depending on this, `build()` could wrap a similar method of an underlying native query builder; or it could combine
the collected arguments and build an actual query; or it could even be a no-op.
The important thing is that it returns a query object that can be immediately executed by the `execute_query()` method.

What exactly this query object is, is up to you. It could be a string, a dictionary, a custom object, or anything else.

### Implement the `execute_query()` method

The `execute_query()` method of your Document Index has to fulfill two requirements:
1. Be able to execute a query that was built by the `build()` method of the corresponding `QueryBuilder` class, and return the results.
2. Be able to execute a native query object of your backend, as a simple pass-through, and return the results. This is intended for users to be able to use the native query language of your backend and manually construct their own queries, if they want to.

How you achieve this is up to you. If 1. and 2. condense down to the same thing because `build()` returns a native query
is also up to you.

The only thing to keep in mind is that any heavy lifting, combining of various inputs and queries, and potential validation
should happen in the `build()` method, and not in `execute_query()`.
