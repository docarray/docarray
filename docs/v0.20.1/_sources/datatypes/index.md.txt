# Multimodal Data

DocArray lets you represent text, image, video, audio, and 3D meshes as Documents, whether separate, nested or combined, and process them as a DocumentArray. Here are some motivating examples:


```{toctree}
text/index
image/index
video/index
audio/index
mesh/index
tabular/index
multimodal/index
```
