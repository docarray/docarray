You can append, extend, insert, pop, and so on. In DocList, data is individually owned by each <code>BaseDoc</code> collect just different Document references. Use <code>DocList</code> when you want to be able to rearrange or re-rank your data. One flaw of <code>DocList</code> is that none of the data is contiguous in memory, so you cannot  leverage functions that require contiguous data without first copying the data in a continuous array.</p> <p><code>DocVec</code> is a columnar data structure. <code>DocVec</code> is always an array of homogeneous Documents. The idea is that every attribute of the <code>BaseDoc</code> will be stored in a contiguous array: a column.</p> <p>This means that when you access the attribute of a <code>BaseDoc</code> at the Array level, we don't collect the data under the hood  from all the documents (like <code>DocList</code>) before giving it back to you. We just return the column that is stored in memory.</p> <p>This really matters when you need to handle multimodal data that you will feed into an algorithm that requires contiguous data, like matrix multiplication which is at the heart of Machine Learning, especially in Deep Learning.</p> <p>Let's take an example to illustrate the difference:</p> <p>Let's say you want to work with an Image:</p> <pre><code>from docarray import BaseDoc\nfrom docarray.typing import NdArray\nclass ImageDoc(BaseDoc):\nimage: NdArray[\n3, 224, 224\n] = None  # [3, 224, 224] this just mean we know in advance the shape of the tensor\n</code></pre> <p>And that you have a function that takes a contiguous array of images as input (like a deep learning model):</p> <pre><code>def predict(image: NdArray['batch_size', 3, 224, 224]):\n...\n</code></pre> <p>Let's create a <code>DocList</code> of <code>ImageDoc</code>s and pass it to the function:</p> <pre><code>from docarray import DocList\nimport numpy as np\ndocs = DocList[ImageDoc](\n[ImageDoc(image=np.random.rand(3, 224, 224)) for _ in range(10)]\n)\npredict(np.stack(docs.image))\n...\npredict(np.stack(docs.image))\n</code></pre> <p>When you call <code>docs.image</code>, <code>DocList</code> loops over the ten documents and collects the image attribute of each document in a list. It is similar to doing:</p> <pre><code>images = []\nfor doc in docs:\nimages.append(doc.image)\n</code></pre> <p>this means that if you call <code>docs.image</code> multiple times, under the hood you will collect the image from each document and stack them several times. This is not optimal.</p> <p>Let's see how it will work with <code>DocVec</code>:</p> <pre><code>from docarray import DocVec\nimport numpy as np\ndocs = DocVec[ImageDoc](\n[ImageDoc(image=np.random.rand(3, 224, 224)) for _ in range(10)]\n)\npredict(docs.image)\n...\npredict(docs.image)\n</code></pre> <p>The first difference is that you don't need to call <code>np.stack</code> on <code>docs.image</code> because <code>docs.image</code> is already a contiguous array. The second difference is that you just get the column and don't need to create it at each call.</p> <p>One of the other main differences between both of them is how you can access documents inside them.</p> <p>If you access a document inside a <code>DocList</code> you will get a <code>BaseDoc</code> instance, i.e. a document.</p> <p>If you access a document inside a <code>DocVec</code> you will get a document view. A document view is a view of the columnar data structure which looks and behaves like a <code>BaseDoc</code> instance. It is a <code>BaseDoc</code> instance but with a different way to access the data.</p> <p>When you make a change at the view level it will be reflected at the DocVec level:</p> <pre><code>from docarray import DocVec\ndocs = DocVec[ImageDoc](\n[ImageDoc(image=np.random.rand(3, 224, 224)) for _ in range(10)]\n)\nmy_doc = docs[0]\nassert my_doc.is_view()  # True\n</code></pre> <p>whereas with DocList:</p> <pre><code>docs = DocList[ImageDoc](\n[ImageDoc(image=np.random.rand(3, 224, 224)) for _ in range(10)]\n)\nmy_doc = docs[0]\nassert not my_doc.is_view()  # False\n</code></pre> <p>Note</p> <p>To summarize: you should use <code>DocVec</code> when you need to work with contiguous data, and you should use <code>DocList</code> when you need to rearrange or extend your data.</p>"},{"location":"user_guide/representing/array/#dealing-with-optional-fields","title":"Dealing with Optional fields","text":"<p>Both <code>DocList</code> and <code>DocVec</code> support nested optional fields but they behave slightly differently.</p> <p>Nested optional field</p> <p>By a \"nested optional field\" we mean a document that is contained within another document, and declared as <code>Optional</code>:</p> <pre><code>from typing import Optional\nfrom docarray import BaseDoc\nclass MyDoc(BaseDoc):\nnested_doc: Optional[BaseDoc]\n</code></pre> <p>Using nested optional fields differs slightly between DocList and DocVes, so watch out.

Relevant concrete examples are neural search applications, augmenting LLMs and chatbots with domain knowledge (Retrieval-Augmented Generation), or recommender systems.</p> <p>How does vector similarity search work?</p> <p>Without going into too much detail, the idea behind vector similarity search is the following:</p> <p>You represent every data point that you have (in our case, a document) as a vector, or embedding. This vector should represent as much semantic information about your data as possible: Similar data points should be represented by similar vectors.</p> <p>These vectors (embeddings) are usually obtained by passing the data through a suitable neural network that has been trained to produce such semantic representations - this is the encoding step.</p> <p>Once you have your vectors that represent your data, you can store them, for example in a vector database.</p> <p>To perform similarity search, you take your input query and encode it in the same way as the data in your database. Then, the database will search through the stored vectors and return those that are most similar to your query. This similarity is measured by a similarity metric, which can be cosine similarity, Euclidean distance, or any other metric that you can think of.</p> <p>If you store a lot of data, performing this similarity computation for every data point in your database is expensive. Therefore, vector databases usually perform approximate nearest neighbor (ANN) search. There are various algorithms for doing this, such as HNSW, but in a nutshell, they allow you to search through a large database of vectors very quickly, at the expense of a small loss in accuracy.</p> <p>DocArray's Document Index concept achieves this by providing a unified interface to a number of vector databases. In fact, you can think of Document Index as an ORM for vector databases.</p> <p>Currently, DocArray supports the following vector databases:</p> <ul> <li>Weaviate  |  Docs</li> <li>Qdrant  |  Docs</li> <li>Elasticsearch v7 and v8  |  Docs</li> <li>HNSWlib  |  Docs</li> </ul> <p>For this user guide you will use the HnswDocumentIndex because it doesn't require you to launch a database server. Instead, it will store your data locally.</p> <p>Using a different vector database</p> <p>You can easily use Weaviate, Qdrant, or Elasticsearch instead -- they share the same API! To do so, check their respective documentation sections.</p> <p>Hnswlib-specific settings</p> <p>The following sections explain the general concept of Document Index by using HnswDocumentIndex as an example.
