# Security Policy

Security is very important for DocArray and its community. 

## Supported Versions

The latest versions of DocArray are supported.


## Reporting a Vulnerability

If you think you've found a vulnerability, even if you are not sure about it, please report it right away by sending an email to security@jina.ai. Please try to be as explicit as possible, describing all the steps and example code to reproduce the security issue.

Our team will review it thoroughly and get back to you.

Please refrain from publicly discussing a potential security vulnerability on Github issues or in Slack community. It's better to discuss it privately and try to find a solution first, to limit the potential impact as much as possible.
